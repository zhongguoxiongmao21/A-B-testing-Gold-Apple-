**Introduction**  

I’ve noticed that I’ve been shopping more ever since I learned about the "Customer Days" promotion in the Golden Apple app. Before, the only discount available was through a loyalty card, but now there’s an option to get 10% off purchases over 5,000 rubles and 15% off purchases over 9,000 rubles during specific days of the month. This means customers can save anywhere from 500 to 1,350 rubles in total.  

I think this system has great potential. It’s important to maximize its benefits because, let’s be honest, discounts trigger our fear of missing out. Often, we end up buying things impulsively—items we don’t really need right now but might use later. I’ve seen this happen not just to me but also to friends and acquaintances who rush to add extra items to their cart just to qualify for the discount.  

This system has a strong influence on my shopping habits. I often fill my cart with less essential items (like cotton pads, laundry detergent, or an extra shampoo) just to hit the spending threshold. In reality, I could either buy these things at a regular supermarket or skip them altogether since I don’t urgently need them.  

Finding a balance between consumer needs and business goals is crucial. Not everything that benefits the buyer is necessarily good for the business. However, I believe that to uncover hidden profit opportunities, businesses should view things from the customer’s perspective and remove obstacles that prevent them from buying more. With this in mind, I’ll outline some key problems and hypotheses, drawing not only from my own experience but also from interviews with other Golden Apple shoppers.
